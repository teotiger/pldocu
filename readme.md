# PLDocu

## Introduction
PLDocu is a PL/SQL Package to extract the necessary information from your source code to build a documentation.

It provides pipelined table functions similarly to the data dictionary views and a function to get a full documentation from a package. The structure follows the API Reference online documentation from Oracle. The output can be different markup like HTML, Markdown or reST.

## Installation
Simply run the install script from the setup folder inside SQL*Plus or SQL Developer.

## Usage
The following example extract all information from package "PLDOCU":

```
select * 
from table(pldocu.package_infos('PLDOCU'))
natural join table(pldocu.subprogram_infos('PLDOCU'))
natural left join table(pldocu.argument_infos('PLDOCU'))
order by sub_id, arg_id;
```
